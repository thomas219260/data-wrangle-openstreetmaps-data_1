Here's a link to the map position I wrangled in my project:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/metro-extracts.mapzen.com/minneapolis-saint-paul_minnesota.osm.bz2

The area in this map contains the Minneapolis - St. Paul metro area,
including the suburbs of Minnetonka and Bloomington.  I chose this area
because it include the University of Minnesota, where I went to graduate
school.
